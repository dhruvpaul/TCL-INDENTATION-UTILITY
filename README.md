# TCL-INDENTATION-UTILITY

A window based application that can be used to indent files of code written in TCL.

It is an application which add spaces/tabs in front of 'blocks' of code (such as If-End If), thus, making it easier for programmer and other people to see how the code flows (ie: which parts of the code will run under certain situations).
